- pre-calculate envelop: 
    - pre-calc attack and decay -> would this make big diff?
    - pre-calc attack and decay with wave but this might be tricky with modulation... unless the asr is just the modulation after the wave. But on wave morph envelop must be re-calculated!
- parameter lock: allow multiple synth param per track, with a master one for the keyboard...

- can the filter be directly applied to the wavetable? (but then not usable for EG filter)

- wavetable directly from SD without to load it in mem
